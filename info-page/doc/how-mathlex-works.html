      </nav><h1>How MathLex Works</h1>
<p>MathLex works in two phases. The first phase compiles a MathLex expression into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that
can be represented in memory, and the second phase converts the AST into some type of output.</p>
<h2>Input &rarr; Syntax Tree</h2>
<p>When provided with a valid MathLex string, <code>MathLex.parse()</code> produces an <em>abstract syntax tree</em> (AST) representing
the inferred value of the MathLex code. Under the hood, the first phase has two components: a preprocessor called a
<strong>Tokenizer</strong> and then the main <strong>Parser</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tokenizer</strong> is responsible for translating the characters in the MathLex input string into a list of <em>Tokens</em>,
a way to group related characters into a single symbol. For example, &quot;&lt;=&quot; is shorthand for &quot;less than or equal to&quot;
(in display math, &#39;&le;&#39;) and is comprised of two separate characters. The Tokenizer groups these characters into a
<code>TLessEqual</code> Token for the Parser. A list of all Tokens is given in <a href="tokens.html">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Parser</strong> then reads the list of tokens and assembles the corresponding AST. The AST is built from different
&quot;node&quot; types represented as a recursive array. Every node has a string name indicating the type of node, and
optionally one or more subnodes for its arguments. The grammar rules used by the parser are given in the
<code>grammar.coffee</code> source file and an overview of all produced tree nodes are given in <a href="tree-nodes.html">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the MathLex input for the quadratic formula,</p>
<p>\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4a\,c}}{2a} \]</p>
<p>is <code>x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)</code>. This is an equation, so the root node is an equality (=), and its two
subnodes are an identifier (\( x \)) and a quotient (&div;), which is further broken down into its subnodes as
displayed in the figure below.</p>

      </figure><h2>Syntax Tree &rarr; Output</h2>
<p>The AST returned by the parser gives a mathematically faithful model of the meaning behind the interpreted input
text. It is evaluated correctly by evaluating each nodes&#39; children and then performing the parent node operation on
the child values (this is called a <em>recursive postorder traversal</em>). Such tools to recursively evaluate the AST are
called <strong>Translators</strong> or <strong>Renderers</strong>. These terms are used interchangeably. So far, tranlators have been written
for LaTeX, Sage CAS (partially), and a textual output of the AST. The author plans to write additional translators
(Maple, Mathematica, and MathML, for example), and volunteers willing and able to help write such translators are
welcome.</p>
<h3>LaTeX Translator</h3>
<p>Using the quadratic formula example above, one could build a LaTeX translator from the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>An equality is represented as &quot;<code>LHS = RHS</code>&quot;</li>
<li>Variables and numbers are expressed as-is</li>
<li>A fraction is represented as &quot;<code>\frac{NUMERATOR}{DENOMINATOR}</code>&quot;</li>
<li>Plus-or-Minus is represented as &quot;<code>LHS \pm RHS</code>&quot;</li>
<li>Negation is represented as &quot;<code>-SUBEXPR</code>&quot;</li>
<li>Square Roots are represented as &quot;<code>\sqrt{SUBEXPR}</code>&quot;</li>
<li>Subtraction is represented as &quot;<code>LHS - RHS</code>&quot;</li>
<li>Exponents are represented as &quot;<code>BASE^{POWER}</code>&quot;. Note the braces around the exponent.</li>
<li>Multiplication is represented as a space between operands: &quot;<code>LHS \, RHS</code>&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This <code>latex</code> translator would start at the root node: since it is an equality, the translator will translate the
left-hand-side (LHS) and the right-hand-side (RHS) and then put an equals sign (=) between them. The LHS is a
variable (\( x \)), so its translated value would be <code>x</code>. The RHS is a quotient, and the numerator and denominator
will each have to be translated before they can be entered into the LaTeX fraction command. The translator will
continue until all sub-nodes are translated, and then the root node&#39;s translation will be returned as</p>

      <pre class="brush: latex">x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4 \, a \, c}}{2 \, a}</pre>
      <h3>Sage Translator</h3><p>The <code>sage</code> translator works similarly and returns the following line of code:</p>

      <pre class="brush: python">x == ( (? PlusMinus ?) )/(2*a)</pre><p>Note that Sage does not support the Plus/Minus operation and therefore cannot accurately be translated. Future
support for this operation may split the returned Sage expression into two forms: one plus, and the other minus. If
the <code>+/-</code> operator is replaced by a <code>+</code>, then the Sage renderer returns</p>

      <pre class="brush: python">x == (-b + sqrt(b^(2) - 4 * a * c))/(2 * a)</pre>
      <h3>Text-Tree Renderer</h3>
      <p>The <code>text-tree</code> renderer yields the following output:</p>
      <pre class="brush: latex">Equal
    Variable: x
        Divide
            PlusMinus
                Negative
                    Variable: b
                Function
                    Builder:
                        Variable: sqrt
                    Arguments:
                        Minus
                            Exponent
                                Variable: b
                                Literal: 2
                            Times
                                Times
                                    Literal: 4
                                    Variable: a
                                Variable: c
            Times
                Literal: 2
                Variable: a
